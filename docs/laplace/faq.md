# FAQ

### About Team Setup
In the team setup section, servant strengthen status can be configured to match that of a specific FGO server. Whether to 
use current user's planning data can also be configured here. When a servant is selected, Laplace will automatically set
servant options matching the current strengthen status config and user's planning data.

Also, craft essence options can also be saved in planning data.

### Ping Servants/CEs to Top
In the details page, there is an option in the top right popup menu to select if a servant or CE is pinged at top.

Also, for CEs Laplace will automatically ping event CEs of the selected quest and bond CEs of the current servant.

### Save Formations
Can be done in the Team menu. In the latest version this works like the in game party system, which means all changes
will only affect the current selected party, and will be automatically saved.

In Beta version, this functionality is modified to behave more like a template, which means changes to the current team
will not affect the saved team.

### Check Detailed Buff
Aside from clicking the servants' icon or manually checking debug logs, the recorded data in the record section can also
be clicked to view specific buffs at that moment.

### Sharing Teams
In the latest version, Laplace supports exporting and importing team data using the buttons in the top right corner of
the Team Setup page.

Sharing team via uploading is currently being developed.
