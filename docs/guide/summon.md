## GSSR Expectation

For guarantee summons(GSSR), you can get each expectation by setting each servant's **score**.
By default, owned servant has score 0, and not-owned servant has score 5. The larger score is more acceptable.

You can sort each GSSR choice by expectation, best prob, worst prob or custom. Let it give you reference about how to choose.
