# Servant Planning

::: tip
The **Servant** and **Plan** page are all for servants. **Plan** page is designed for batch changing the servant skill levels.

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Servant List Page<br><small>1-Favorite/Other/All, 2-Filter, 3-Search, 4-Popup Menu, 5-Class Filter, 6-Hide One, 7-Batch Setting</small></figcaption>

## Servant List Page

Similar to CE and Command Code list, it shows servants' name, number, class and current skill levels if favorite.

### Favorite

Switch list among **SHOW ALL**, **FAVORITE** and **NOT FAVORITE**.

The default behavior can be set in [Display Settings](./app_setting.md#display_settings)

### Filter

Provide the detailed servant basic info, traits, plan status and skill/NP effect filter. Effect filter doesn't include append skill since all append skills are almost the same.
See [Buff Filter](./buff_filter.md) for details.

### Search

- custom search scope: basic, skill, NP...
- some key fields support Chinese Pinyin and Japanese Romaji search
- multiple keyword support, see [Search](./search_filter.md) for details.

### Popup Menu

Not all options are shown in different pages.

- **Select Plan**: support at most 5 plans
- **Copy Plan from...**: Copy another plan to current plan

### Top Class Filter Style

Go to [Display Settings](./app_setting.md#display-settings) to choose the class filter style

## Plan List Page

Different from **Servant List Page**, it shows the servant detail level info for ascension, palingenesis, skills and costume,
both current value and target value.

::: tip
Main purpose of this page is to **batch** changing all shown servants' level.
:::

You can custom shown servants by filter dialog. What's more, click the trailing **:eye_speech_bubble:Hide** button will hide the specific servant which won't respond to your batch setting.

Make sure the correct plan is selected. Every account supports multiple plans, you can switch or copy plan in the popup menu.

### Batch Settings

There are the functions for every button:

- Set all for `Current` status or `Target` plan
- Jump to Item List Page
- Dropdown button to batch change value
  - ascension
  - all 3 active skills
  - append skill(s): you can set changing **only 2nd** or **all 3** append skill(s) in [Display Settings](./app_setting.md#display-settings)
  - all costumes

When you click `Lv.x`, all shown servants' current/target level will change to `Lv.x`.

If you select `x+1` for skills, it means change from `Lv.x` to `Lv.x+1`. For me, mostly used for check which item is lacking at the moment.

## Detail Page - Plan Tab

<figcaption style="text-align:center">Servant Detail Page<br><small>1-Favorite, 2-Popup Menu, 3-Growth Curve, 4-Priority, 5-Custom Tab Sorting, 6-Plan Settings, 7-Toolbar(Enhancement and Shortcuts)</small></figcaption>

::: tip
Switch **Slider Mode** and **Dropdown Mode** in the popup menu.
:::

### Favorite

:heart: :white_heart:

Add servant into plan or remove from plan. Changing current or plan value will automatically set favorite:heart:.

The item detail page only shows favorite servants' demands by default.

### Popup Menu

- **Select Plan**: same as above
- **Reset**: Reset this servant's all status and plan
- **Reset Plan**: Only reset plan to current status
- **Jump to**: Jump to wiki pages
- **Switch Slider/Dropdown**: switch display mode as you like
- **Create Duplicated Servant**: see following section

### Duplicated Servant

By default, we use servant collection number as key. So every servant can have only one instance. Here we call it **Primary** one.

If your true love is Ishtar, and want to plan 2 Ishtar for same servant collection number. You can create **duplicated** servant. in popup menu.

e.g. the number of primary Ishtar is No.142, the duplicated Ishtar has a new number of No.142001. ~~which means you can create at most 999 duplicated servants.~~

::: warning
Duplicated servants may cause some potential bugs, if encountered, please tell me.
:::

### Priority :one:~:five:

Apply different priority for servants, as an extra filter property. Default to P1, ranges from P1 to P5.

E.g. set low rarity cards to P1, SR&SSR cards to P2, upcoming servants to P3. It's convenient to filter out which priority servants should be added into plan.

> To remember the meanings of P1~P5, you can set the label for priorities in [Display Settings-Priority Tagging](./app_setting.md#display-settings)

::: warning
The priority filter in servant list page, item list page and statistic page, share the global priority filter setting.
Unchecked priority won't be added into plan. What's more, all unselected=all selected.
:::

### Leveling Plan

In **Plan** tab, For every attribute with range values, the left value is **current level**, and the right value is **target/plan value**.
If it's not a range, just a single value, it won't be included in plan, just recording such a info, like NP level.

Click the right info button :information_source: to check the item cost details or tips.

1. Ascension - 0~4
2. Active Skill - 1~10
3. Costume Unlock - 0 means locked, 1 means unlocked
4. Append Skill - 0~10, `0/-` means unlocked, 0-1 will cost 120 coins
5. Servant coin - coin amount of servant specific coin
6. Palingenesis - max level(0 grail)~Lv.120(n grails), differ from servant rarity
7. NP level - just recording, not used
8. HP/ATK Fou-kun - 0~2000, 1000 by default. The internal value and shown value has such relations:
   - `0` Fou-kun = `-20`(calculated by silver(3) Fou-kun)
   - `1000` Fou-kun = `0`
   - `2000` Fou-kun = `50`(calculated by gold(4) Fou-kun)
9. Command Codes - it's easy to find out code pinned on which servants in code detail page
